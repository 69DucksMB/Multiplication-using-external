# Multiply easy random numbers, the more you do, the higher the score.
# Stores the Highscore and the username in a txt file
# Allows user to save their highscore and see highscores of previous runs
# ======================

# Storing the Highscore and usernames in a text file, allows the possibility to save multiple highscores and usernames permanently even after closing the program.
# You can recall all highscores
